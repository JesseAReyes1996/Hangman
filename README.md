# Hangman

Written using Python 3.6.1

A terminal based version of the classic multiplayer game Hangman.

This project is meant to showcase my knowledge of threading as well as sockets, both blocking and non-blocking.

To run this game open up a minimum of three terminals. One terminal should be in the same directory as server.py.

Run "python server.py"

The other two will connect to the server using telnet.
Use the command "telnet localhost 8238" to connect to the server.
